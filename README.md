This is a large scale knn project designed to test various approaches from the literature.

To recreate the pdf paper on k-means clustering, use the following commands in the `docs/scaling-k-means` directory:

    $ /usr/texbin/pdflatex scaling-k-means.tex 
    $ /usr/texbin/bibtex scaling-k-means
    $ /usr/texbin/pdflatex scaling-k-means.tex 
    $ /usr/texbin/pdflatex scaling-k-means.tex 

You will need to install pdftex to do this. MacTex and TexShop provide nice capabilities
for dealing with latex files.  See http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/installing.html
and http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/obtaining.html
